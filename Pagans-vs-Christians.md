The clash between Norse paganism and Christianity was a significant aspect of the Viking Age and the subsequent Christianization of Scandinavia. This conflict was not always violent, but it did involve cultural, political, and sometimes military confrontations.

## Timeline of Key Events

1. **793 CE**: Viking raid on Lindisfarne monastery in England, often seen as the beginning of the Viking Age and conflicts with Christian kingdoms.

2. **826-831 CE**: Ansgar's first mission to Scandinavia, attempting to introduce Christianity to Denmark and Sweden.

3. **960-980s CE**: Harald Bluetooth's conversion and efforts to Christianize Denmark.

4. **995-1000 CE**: Olaf Tryggvason's forceful Christianization efforts in Norway.

5. **1015-1028 CE**: Olaf II Haraldsson (St. Olaf) continues Christianization in Norway, often through violent means.

6. **1075 CE**: Adam of Bremen writes about the pagan temple at Uppsala, one of the last strongholds of Norse paganism.

7. **12th Century**: The gradual Christianization of Sweden is completed.

## Nature of the Conflict

### Cultural and Religious Differences

1. **Polytheism vs Monotheism**: The Norse pantheon conflicted with Christian monotheism.
2. **Afterlife Concepts**: Valhalla and Hel vs Heaven and Hell.
3. **Moral Systems**: Different values and ethical frameworks.

### Political Dimensions

1. **Royal Conversions**: Kings often converted for political alliances and used Christianity to consolidate power.
2. **Resistance to Foreign Influence**: Some saw Christianity as a threat to traditional Norse culture and independence.

### Methods of Conversion

1. **Peaceful Mission**: Early attempts focused on persuasion and demonstrating Christian practices.
2. **Forced Conversion**: Some rulers used violence and legal coercion to impose Christianity.
3. **Syncretism**: Blending of Christian and pagan beliefs to ease transition.

## Notable Conflicts and Resistances

### Norway

- Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf II Haraldsson used force to destroy pagan shrines and compel conversion.
- The Battle of Stiklestad (1030) saw Christian and pagan Norwegians clash.

### Denmark

- Gradual conversion with less overt conflict.
- Harald Bluetooth's runestone at Jelling declares the Christianization of Denmark.

### Sweden

- Longer resistance to Christianity, especially in Uppsala.
- Pagan reaction in the 1080s led by Blot-Sweyn, temporarily reverting to paganism.

### Iceland

- Largely peaceful conversion decided by the Althing (parliament) in 1000 CE to prevent civil war.

## Long-term Consequences

1. **Syncretism**: Many pagan traditions were incorporated into Scandinavian Christianity.
2. **Literacy**: Introduction of Latin alphabet and written culture.
3. **Political Integration**: Scandinavian kingdoms became part of broader European Christian community.
4. **Cultural Shift**: Gradual transformation of Norse society and worldview.

## Modern Perspectives

- Academic study of this period has evolved, moving away from simplistic "pagans vs Christians" narratives.
- Recognition of the complex, gradual nature of religious change in Scandinavia.
- Revival of interest in Norse paganism (Ásatrú) in modern times, though as a reconstructed religion.
